            Bangladesh views that maintaining peace and addressing conflicts is
            central to peoples’ progress. During the recent Revolution, our
            valiant armed forces have once again shown their commitment to peace
            by standing firmly with the people in fulfilling their aspirations
            for freedom during a most difficult time in our history. This was
            possible thanks to our commitment to place human rights at the core
            of peacekeeping. Bangladesh remains equally committed to
            peace-building, from the inception of the UN Peace-building
            Commission. We look forward to promoting and enhancing Bangladesh’s
            value-driven contributions to the UN peace-keeping operations.
